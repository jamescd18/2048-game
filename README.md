This is my attempt at creating the simple yet popular game 2048 in Dr. Racket's ISL+ teaching language. 

The game rules and visual design are recreated from my memory and by no means a perfect replicate. Design Recipe methodology from the How To Design Program textbook are attempted in structuring the code.

After consulting someone that knows the game better and has played it siginificantly more than I have, I have come to the realization that the game logic I have coded is distinctly different from that of the real game. I have chosen to continue with my current interpretation, as I feel it will yield interesting results.

Of note about my version:
- One key press operation will collapse numbers until the can no longer be collapsed further
- The game board is 5 by 5 rather than the original 4 by 4
